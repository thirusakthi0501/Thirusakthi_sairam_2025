'''
Cities on a map are connected by a number of roads. The number of roads between each city is in an array and city 0 is the starting location. The number of roads from city 0 to city 1 is the first value in the array, from city 1 to city 2 is the second, and so on.

How many paths are there from city 0  to the last city in the list, modulo 1234567?

Example

n=4
routes=[3,4,5]

There are 3 roads to city 1, 4 roads to city 2 and 5 roads to city 3. The total number of roads is 3*4*5 mod 1234567=60.

Note
Pass all the towns Ti for i=1 to n-1 in numerical order to reach Tn.

Function Description

Complete the connectingTowns function in the editor below.

connectingTowns has the following parameters:

int n: the number of towns
int routes[n-1]: the number of routes between towns
Returns

int: the total number of routes, modulo 1234567.
Input Format
The first line contains an integer T, T test-cases follow.

Each test-case has 2 lines.
The first line contains an integer N (the number of towns).
The second line contains N - 1 space separated integers where the ith integer denotes the number of routes, Ni, from the town Ti to Ti+1

Constraints
1 <= T<=1000
2< N <=100
1 <= routes[i] <=1000

Sample Input

2
3
1 3
4
2 2 2
Sample Output

3
8
Explanation
Case 1: 1 route from T1 to T2, 3 routes from T2 to T3, hence only 3 routes.
Case 2: There are 2 routes from each city to the next, hence 2 * 2 * 2 = 8.
